# Receive PPY



  
The receive PPY functionality allows a logged in Scatter user to get their Peerplays address. To access the "Receive PPY" screen, perform the following steps:

â€Œ

* From the home screen, click on the Wallet button at the bottom of the application window.

* After clicking on the Wallet button in the prior step, you will be shown a list of networks available. The order of these networks may not match Figure 3.7.2 so use the search bar if needed to find PPY.

* If you hover over the PPY entry, you will have access to a button \("Receive"\) that allows you to view your Peerplays address and a QR code that can be scanned to show the same information.
